# polymer_examples
Example polymers for testing.

### Existing polymers
* simple_polymers/
   * PANAM
   * Natural rubber
   * Vulcanized rubber

### Cases we would still like to have

  * Glycosylated proteins (test connections of glycosylations)
  * Various sugars 
  * Crosslinked polyamide membrane
  * Crosslinked lytropic liquid crystal
  * PEGylated protein
  * Protein with dye attached
  * Nucleic acid
     * DNA
     * RNA
     * Artificial bases
  * Protein
  * Large stress cases?  
  * Sulfonamide polymer?  Sulfur with the SAME local connectivity but different formal charge.
  * Random polymers?
