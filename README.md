# polymer_examples
Example polymers for testing.

### Existing polymers
* simple_polymers/
   * PANAM
   * Natural rubber
   * Vulcanized rubber
* sugars/
   * trimannose
   * dextran
   * chitin
   * cellulose
   * A really messy one with branches and lots of different sugars
* crosslinked_polymers
   * xlinked.pdb: crosslinked lyotropic liquid crystal
* Nucleic acids
   * 2q1r (rna)
   * 7sb8 (dna)
   * 6x5d (dna, with chemical modifications)
 * Functionalized proteins
   * Cystine with a dye

### Cases we would still like to have
  * Crosslinked polyamide membrane
  * PEGylated protein
  * Protein with dye attached
  * Large stress cases?  
  * Sulfonamide polymer?  Sulfur with the SAME local connectivity but different formal charge.
  * Random polymers?
