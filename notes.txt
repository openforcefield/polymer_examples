paam_drei_no_wtr.pdb has a problem with the H's at the terminal groups -> ends in a CH2
pnipam_drei_no_wtr.pdb -> same thing
peg_c35r_no_wtr.pdb has a problem with terminal groups -> CC3 instead of CH3 ?
Pet.pdb just doesn't make sense before or after running through openeye
polyethylene.pdb doesn't work because there is more than one polymer
polypyrrole.pdb -> H added somewhere in cleaning process!

molecules that break the isomorphism selection algorithm:
dextran, vulcanized rubber, messy_sugar

line 4435 in parameters.py -> large molecules get hung up on the ChargeIncrementModelHandler? 

updates since last time:
same basic workflow seen to get substructures and simulate them, but now just diving into testing
1) some code has been moved to the topology class to accomodate pdb files with molecule chains or molecules
2) any caching with very large chains (such as with polyethylene) takes a very long time, since
    isomorphism matching between two large molecules takes a long time and outweighs the benefit of 
    caching. I bet there is some time complexity argument here, where the toolkit without caching scales 
    by roughly N since you are just repeating the same computations over and over, but caching actually scales
    by N^2 or more, since isomorphism matching is involved to find where caching is useful
3) no working simulations of DNA or RNA, but all of the backbone and amino acids have chemical info
    - due to openmm interpreting some strange bonds between water molecules, as well as some
        floating metal ions that have bonds to water molecules 
4) no working simulations of a functionalized protein, but T4_protein can be simulated
    - strange groups on 6cww.pdb that don't make sense chemically
5) all sugars and simple polymers are working now (even vulcanized rubber), with the exception of messy_sugar,
    since this one is just a lot of work and I haven't had the time. 
6) run simulate_polymer.py -> what's up?
