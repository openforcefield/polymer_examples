These files are 1000-atom manually-created versions of some homopolymers. The script in ../generate_large_homopolymers.py takes these and generates 9,16,25,etc... thousand atom systems by copying many of these polymer chains together. These large homopolymer systems were those used to benchmark `Topology.from_pdb` and for large homopolymer systems. This procedure of copying many 1000-atoms systems was used because 1) generating conformers for 1k+ systems takes a very long time and 2) generating conformers for long linear polymers tends to overflow the number spaces available in pdb files to represent decimal numbers.
